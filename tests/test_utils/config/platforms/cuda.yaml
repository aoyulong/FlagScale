# CUDA-Based Platform Configuration
# Flexible test selection mechanism for NVIDIA GPU environments
#
# This platform configuration supports multiple device types (a100, a800, h100)
# Users can modify the following:
# - functional: Add/remove test case names in the support lists
#   Example: aquila: ["tp2_pp2", "tp4_pp2"] -> add or remove items
# - unit: Add/remove paths in include and exclude lists
#   Example: include: "*" or ["test_basic.py", "runner/*"]
#            exclude: [] or ["test_spiky_loss_detector.py"]
